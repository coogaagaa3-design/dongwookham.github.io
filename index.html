        <h2>🌱 A Story of Growth</h2>
        
        <div class="growth-story-container">
            <div class="growth-story-text text-block">
                <p>I was born with a condition called **pectus excavatum**. Ever since I was young, my parents were deeply concerned about my health. To help me grow stronger, they encouraged me to try various sports—swimming, speed skating, ice hockey, golf, basketball, soccer, and table tennis. Although I never stood out in any particular field, I always enjoyed these experiences.</p>
                <p>However, there was one event that completely changed the way I saw myself. My parents often sent me to camps in the U.S. and Australia for diverse experiences. One unforgettable moment happened at a YMCA swimming pool in the U.S. While my older brother passed a simple swim test and got a bracelet that allowed him to go down a huge, twisting water slide, I failed due to my short breath and weak lung capacity.</p>
                <p>I was left behind in another section of the pool, and for the first time, I thought, **"Maybe I'm not capable."**</p>
                <p>That day became a turning point. It wasn’t just disappointment—it was the moment I came to accept my body seriously, and eventually, we decided on surgery.</p>
                <p>Through corrective surgery, a titanium bar was inserted into my chest for two years to raise my sunken sternum. During that time, my parents were constantly worried I might get hurt. But going through that period made my **body and mind stronger**. Now, I live a healthy life enjoying basketball, bowling, and table tennis.</p>

            <h3>Resilience Forged in Challenges</h3>
            <p>The failure at the swimming pool led to the ultimate decision to undergo surgery. The pain and endurance required during recovery taught me that **persistence leads to a stronger version of myself**, both physically and mentally.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>The Logic of Code</h3>
                <p>Since the third grade, I started learning Python and gradually explored various programming languages. At first, it was difficult, but as I began to understand the logic behind the code and saw the results of my work, I started to feel a strong sense of enjoyment and achievement.</p>
                <p>I’ve learned HTML, JavaScript, Python, C, and C++, and what I discovered is that more important than the languages themselves is the way you think about and solve problems. **Debugging helped me develop persistence and logical thinking.**</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Future Foundation</h3>
                <p>Though I don’t yet have a strong portfolio, I believe the learning experiences I’ve accumulated will become the foundation for future growth. I’m especially interested in **game development** and have been practicing steadily. I've created simple websites, worked on coding projects, and I'm preparing to release a small game soon.</p>

        <div class="content-grid">
            <div class="text-block" style="grid-column: 1 / span 2;">
                <p>Since entering middle school, I have participated in various volunteer activities related to the environment, libraries, and a community-sharing fridge. One experience that left a lasting impression on me was the **sharing fridge project**. I cooked meals at home and delivered them to a welfare center, where they were stored and repackaged for people in need.</p>
                <p>This experience made me feel the **true warmth of sharing**, and I began to think, "How can I expand this kind of volunteering to reach more people?" This led me to the idea of using data to better match those who need help with available resources.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold; color: var(--accent);">My Vision:</p>
                <p>As a result, I began to envision an **AI-based resource-matching system** for community-sharing fridges. I hope to become someone who can deliver kindness and warmth to the world through technology.</p>

                <h3>Joy in Friendship and Learning</h3>
                <p>I’ve had a close group of friends since elementary school. We still have pajama parties and talk about our worries and dreams. Some of my friends started aiming to study abroad, and that meant needing better grades.</p>
                <p>When one of them was struggling with math, I gave him a math workbook as a birthday present, and we started studying together. Since I attend a different school with a different exam schedule, I prepared and printed practice materials for my friends to help them study. We studied together at a local café, and their hard work **inspired me as well**. The memories we made through studying are more than just academic—are cherished parts of my life.</p>

                <h3>Artistic Freedom</h3>
                <p>My mother is an **artist**, and from a young age, my brother and I were surrounded by creative experiences. When we were little, we wore firefighter costumes and played games where we used water guns to **"put out fires" we had drawn on the bathroom walls**.</p>
                <p>As we got older, my mother ordered large canvases that filled our living room, and over several months, we each completed a personal artwork. I became fascinated by drawing faces. She taught me that different artists can express the same face in entirely different ways. Through her guidance, I learned to appreciate **freedom in expression and the beauty of individual style**.</p>

            "I hope to grow into someone who embraces my own color<br>and gives back what I’ve learned to others."

        <p style="max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; color: #666;">
            I want to attend a school where diverse thoughts are respected, where I can grow by learning and taking on new challenges with others. I believe this school will help me shape my story into something even greater.
